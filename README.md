# Stream

Welcome to Stream! ðŸŽ¥

Stream is a backend service for uploading and hosting videos, inspired by my fascination with how YouTubeâ€™s backend works. I decided to build one myself!

I'm fasinated by how the backend of Youtube works and hence i have built one.

It's built using TypeScript, Next.js, Express and Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, FireStore, FireBase)
